            <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.</p>
            <p>In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that introduced the concepts of special relativity and the photoelectric effect, among others. This year is often referred to as his "Annus Mirabilis" or "miracle year". These works laid the foundation for modern physics and earned him worldwide fame.</p>
            <p>Einstein continued to work on his theories, and in 1915, he presented his general theory of relativity, providing a new description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. This theory was confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919, when the predicted deflection of light by gravity was observed.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life, Einstein was also known for his pacifist and humanitarian views. He was a prominent advocate for civil rights and opposed war and violence. In 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Einstein, who was Jewish, emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
            <p>Einstein's contributions to science and his advocacy for peace and human rights have left an indelible mark on the world. He passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, leaving behind a legacy of scientific innovation and a philosophy of curiosity and humanitarianism.</p>
